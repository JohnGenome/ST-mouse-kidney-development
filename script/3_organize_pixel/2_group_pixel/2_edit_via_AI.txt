To partition the whole kidney into different layers, we: 
filter out cells belonging to ureter, 
and outline the cells located at layer boundaries manually. 
Cells are divided into L1 L2 L3 L4 L5, while boundaries are divided into B0 B1 B2 B3 B4 B5.

More specifically, we take cells at cortical surface as the outer cortex boundary, 
cells at the junction of NP/UBT and PT prog/D prog as the inner cortex boundary, 
cells at the junction of PT/Pod and oMFib as the outer medulla boundary, 
cells at the junction of oMFib and mMFib as the intermediate medulla boundary, 
cells at the junction of mMFib and iMFib as the inner medulla boundary and pelvic cells as the most inner boundary.

Note: Save the svg before & after splitting in the same format.
